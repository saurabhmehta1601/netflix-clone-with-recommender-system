`NOTE`: Our recommender system is content based .

## The project is build by following these parts  :

1. Finding dataset and cleaning the dataset for our use case .
2. Training and testing the Machine Learning model with the dataset .
3. Building Single Page Application frontend with Reactjs .
4. Building backend server with flask framework in python with deployed ML Model .

### 1. Finding dataset and cleaning the data for our use case
The dataset for training our ML model is [ TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset ]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata ) which is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
